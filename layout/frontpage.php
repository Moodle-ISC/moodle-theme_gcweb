                <h2>WET-BOEW-Moodle Working Example</h2>
                <p>The theme is currently under early development so you might notice a few things that are not quite finish yet. Check back in upcoming months or contribute financially or through development efforts to this project in order to accelerate the process. For more information and source code, visit the <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle">WET-BOEW-Moodle project</a> page.</p>
                <p>This page is a configurable front page example for your Moodle LMS. It is displayed when users are signed out of the website.</p>
                <p>As you explore this demo site, you will quickly notice that we aren\'t just hiding Moodle behind a few themed pages. The whole site is suitable for public facing training.</p>
