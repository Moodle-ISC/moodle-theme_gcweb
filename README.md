## Important notice

**This is the final release of the WET-BOEW-MOODLE THEME v4.0.23. No additional development will be done for the following reasons:**

* The Government of Canada no longer supports these themes.
* Moodle no longer supports the base theme upon which this was built.
* The WET-BOEW-PHP project has not been updated to reflect the 2019 Canada.ca GCWeb and GCIntranet themes.
* The source code was getting too hard to maintain.

The good news is that development has started on a new native Moodle WET-BOEW-Moodle GCWeb and GCIntranet themes and good progress has been made as seen on the
WET-BOEW-Moodle Workimg Examples site which now showcases the new 2019 4.0.30 edition of the theme: [wet-boew-moodle.tngconsulting.ca](http://wet-boew-moodle.tngconsulting.ca/)

**Please contact the primary project maintainer, [Michael Milette, TNG Consulting Inc.](https://www.tngconsulting.ca/contact), if you want to support this project financially or contribute your time and effort to the development of these new themes.**

**Status for v4.0.23 theme:**

* Initial development and specification design.
* General look and feel now working (see new screenshot).
* WET-BOEW framework files are included in this release (2019-09-26).
* Compatible with Moodle 3.1. Has not been tested with other vesions of Moodle and is definitely not compatible as as of Moodle 3.7.

TODO list still includes:

* Resolving conflicts with base theme.
* Add support for multiple languages.
* Improve accessibility.
* Add theme settings.
* Adding new UI/UX features.
* Ensure that Moodle menus are included on all pages.
* Fix the GC Intranet and Canada.ca themes.
* Add the base theme.
* Add the Canada.ca 2019 redesign themes including GCWeb and GGIntranet.
* Cleanup code.
* Create splash page and 404 server page.
* Quality Assurance and WCAG 2.0 level AA testing.
* Write documentation.

Note: I am currently focusing on finding my next employer/client so the progress of the WET-BOEW-Moodle project will slow down for now. If you know of anyone who is looking for someone with my skills or want more information, please contact me through my website at www.tngconsulting.ca. -- Michael Milette

## What is the Web Experience Toolkit (WET-BOEW)?

See [github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew)

## What is Moodle LMS? 

If you are familiar with Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress™, Drupal™ and Joomla™, Moodle™ is similar except that it is specifically designed to support education through online and in-class e-learning activities.

One of the most popular Learning Management Systems (LMS) in the world, Moodle is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) web-based application designed for those who would rather spend their time, money and efforts on developing effective e-learning courses instead of perpetual expensive yearly software licences costing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. High priorities of the Moodle project team include things like accessibility, support for multiple languages and security.

## The WET-BOEW-Moodle project

The purpose of WET-BOEW-Moodle project on GitHub is to create a world-class accessible theme for Moodle based on version 4.0 of the award winning WET-BOEW framework. It will be a relatively easy to maintain open source WCAG 2.0 Level AA accessible theme for Moodle based on the WET-BOEW 4.0 framework. Most of the configurable settings will be accessible to Moodle administrators through web based configuration pages.

This will hopefully enable organizations to focus their limited educational/training budgets on delivering effective sustainable educational/e-learning content instead of expensive and never ending software licenses.

## Interested in this project?

Let us know by [dropping us a note](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/issues/1). It's the best time to get involved when we are at the design stage.

We would especially love to hear from:
* People who are planning on or currently using Moodle within the Government of Canada or the private sector
* Developers who would like to contribute to this project

If you have any ideas, suggestions or code to share, please [create a new separate issue](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/issues) for each one.

## Why should I contribute?

There is a wasteful situation going on in this world, the duplication of time, money and effort. This is severely limiting creativity, innovation and evolution each time someone has to re-create the wheel. 

By contributing your ideas, you may see them get implemented and supported in future releases. Contributed code has a chance of being integrated into future releases of WET-BOEW-Moodle as well. Together with the modular nature of Moodle, this makes it a lot easier to upgrade when new releases of WET-BOEW-Moodle and Moodle become available.

If you are part of Government, education or other large corporations, you can save money by avoiding duplicate spending on development to achieve similar results. As an individual developer, you also get recognition for your contribution efforts.

## System Requirements

WET-BOEW-Moodle is compatible with Moodle 3.1.x LTS (Long Term Support) on Apache based web servers only. Details of [Web server, database and web browser requirements](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_3.1_release_notes#Server_requirements) can be found on Moodle.org. Support for other versions of Moodle may be added at a later date depending on the level of interest.

Note: The WET-BOEW-Moodle theme will also include web based mobile support on iOS and Android devices.

These specifications and requirements may change as the initial development gets under way.

## Documentation

Documentation will be available in [the project's Wiki](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/wiki). This will include:
* Changelog
* Installation
* Configuration
* Updating WET-BOEW-Moodle

## Limitations

The Canada.ca theme has limited support at this stage of the project due to limitations in the Canada.ca **Content and Information Architecture Specification** but we are working on it.

We will be looking for volunteers to test RTL text support. Until then, this feature will not be tested.
