#wet-boew-moodle

Web Experience Toolkit (WET) Moodle variant.

**Status:** Initial development and specification design

##What is the Web Experience Toolkit (WET-BOEW)?

See https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew

##What is Moodle LMS? 

If you are familiar with Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress™, Drupal™ and Joomla™, Moodle™ is similar except that it is specifically designed to support education through online and in-class e-learning activities.

One of the most popular Learning Management Systems (LMS) in the world, Moodle is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) web-based application designed for those who would rather spend their time, money and efforts on developing effective e-learning courses instead of perpetual expensive yearly software licences costing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. High priorities of the Moodle project team include things like accessibility, support for multiple languages and security.

##The WET-BOEW-MOODLE project

The purpose of WET-BOEW-MOODLE project on GitHub is to create a world-class accessible theme for Moodle based on the award winning WET-BOEW framework. It will be a relatively easy to maintain open source WCAG 2.0 Level AA accessible theme for Moodle based on the WET-BOEW 4.0 framework. Most of the configurable settings will be accessible to Moodle administrators through web based configuration pages.

This will hopefully enable organizations to focus their limited educational/training budgets on delivering effective sustainable educational/e-learning content instead of expensive and never ending software licenses.

##Interested in this project?

Let us know by [dropping us a note](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/issues/1). It's the best time to get involved when we are at the design stage.

We would especially love to hear from:

* People who are planning on or currently using Moodle within the Government of Canada or the private sector
* Developers who would like to contribute to this project

If you have any ideas, suggestions or code to share, please [create a new separate issue](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/issues) for each one.

##Why should I contribute?

There is a wasteful situation going on in this world, the duplication of time, money and effort. This is severely limiting creativity, innovation and evolution each time someone has to re-create the wheel. 

By contributing your ideas, you may see them get implemented and supported in future releases. Contributed code has a chance of being integrated into future releases of WET-BOEW-MOODLE as well. Together with the modular nature of Moodle, this makes it a lot easier to upgrade when new releases of WET-BOEW-MOODLE and Moodle become available.

If you are part of Government, education or other large corporations, you can save money by avoiding duplicate spending on development to achieve similar results. As an individual developer, you also get recognition for your contribution efforts.

##System Requirements

WET-BOEW-MOODLE will initially be released for Moodle 3.1.x LTS (Long Term Support) but be supported on Apache based web servers only. Details of [Web server, database and web browser requirements](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_3.1_release_notes#Server_requirements) can be found on Moodle.org. Support for other versions of Moodle may be added at a later date depending on the level of interest.

Note: The WET-BOEW-MOODLE theme will also include web based mobile support on iOS and Android devices.

These specifications and requirements may change as the initial development gets underway.

##Documentation

Documentation will be available in [the project's Wiki](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/wiki). This will include:
* Changelog
* Installation
* Configuration
* Updating WET-BOEW-MOODLE
* Uninstallation

##Limitations

The Canada.ca theme will not be supported with the initial release due to limitations in the Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification.

We will be looking for volunteers to test RTL text support. Until then, this feature will not be tested.
